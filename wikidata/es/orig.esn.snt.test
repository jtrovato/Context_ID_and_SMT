Andorra
Andorra , officially the Principality of Andorra -LRB- -RRB- , also called the Principality of the Valleys of Andorra , is a small landlocked country in western Europe , located in the eastern Pyrenees mountains and bordered by Spain and France .
It is currently a prosperous country mainly because of tourism and its status as a tax haven .
The people of Andorra are currently listed as having the highest human life expectancy in the world , at an average of 85 years at birth .
Andorra is the sixth smallest nation in Europe .
Its name is thought to be derived from an ancient Basque tribe , the Andosinos , who are believed to have inhabited that region of the Pyrenees thousands of years ago .
History
Tradition holds that Charles the Great -LRB- Charlemagne -RRB- granted a charter to the Andorran people in return for fighting against the Moors .
Overlordship of the territory was of the local count of Urgell and eventually to the bishop of the diocese of Urgell .
In 988 Borrell II count of Urgell gave the Andorran valleys to the Diocese of Urgell when the count expanded to the south .
Since then the Bishop of Urgell , locally known as the bishop of the la Seu d'Urgell , has owned Andorra .
Andorra did not have any type of protection and the Bishop of Urgell , who knew that the Count of Urgell wanted to reclaim the Andorran valleys , decided to ask for help and protection from the Lord of Caboet .
In 1095 , the Lord of Caboet and the Bishop of la Seu d'Urgell signed under oath the recognition of their sovereignty over Andorra .
Arnalda , daughter of Arnau of Caboet , married the Viscount of Castellbò and both became Viscounts of Castellbò and Cerdanya .
Years later their daughter , Ermessenda , married Roger Bernat II of the French Count of Foix .
They became Roger Bernat II and Ermessenda I Counts of Foix , Viscounts of Castellbò and Cerdanya and also sovereigns of Andorra -LRB- shared with the Bishop of Urgell -RRB- .
In the eleventh century a dispute arose between the bishop of la Seu d'Urgell and Count of Foix .
The conflict was resolved in 1278 by the signing of the first paréage , with the mediation of Aragon , which provided that Andorra 's sovereignty be shared between the count of Foix -LRB- whose title would ultimately transfer to the French head of state -RRB- and the bishop of Urgell , in Catalonia .
This gave the small principality its territory and political form .
Over the years the title passed to the kings of Navarre , and after Henry of Navarre became King Henry IV of France he issued an edict -LRB- 1607 -RRB- that established the head of the French state and the Bishop of Urgell as co-princes of Andorra .
In the period 1812–13 , the First French Empire annexed Catalonia and divided it in four départements .
Andorra was also annexed and made part of the district of Puigcerdà -LRB- département of Sègre -RRB- .
Andorra declared war on Imperial Germany during World War I but did not actually take part in the fighting .
It remained in an official state of belligerency until 1957 as it was not included in the Versailles Peace Treaty .
In 1933 France occupied Andorra as a result of social unrest before elections .
On July 12 , 1934 , an adventurer named Boris Skossyreff issued a proclamation in Urgell , declaring himself Boris I , sovereign prince of Andorra , simultaneously declaring war on the bishop of Urgell .
He was arrested by Spanish authorities on July 20 and ultimately expelled from Spain .
From 1936 to 1940 , a French detachment was garrisoned in Andorra to prevent influences of the Spanish Civil War and Franco 's Spain .
Francoist troops reached the Andorran border in the later stages of the war .
During World War II , Andorra remained neutral and was an important smuggling route between Vichy France and Spain .
Given its relative isolation , Andorra has existed outside the mainstream of European history , with few ties to countries other than France and Spain .
In recent times , however , its thriving tourist industry along with developments in transportation and communications have removed the country from its isolation .
Its political system was thoroughly modernized in 1993 , the year in which it became a member of the United Nations and the Council of Europe .

Politics
Andorra is a parliamentary co-principality with the President of France and the Bishop of Urgell -LRB- Catalonia -RRB- , Spain , as co-princes , in a duumvirate .
The politics of Andorra take place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democracy , whereby the Prime Minister of Andorra is the head of government , and of a multi-party system .
The current Prime Minister is Albert Pintat Santolària of the Andorran Liberal Party -LRB- PLA -RRB- .
Executive power is exercised by the government .
Legislative power is vested in both the government and parliament .
The Parliament of Andorra is known as the General Council .
The General Council consists of between 28 and 42 Councilors , as the members of the legislative branch are called .
The Councilors serve for four-year terms and elections are held within the thirtieth and fortieth days following the dissolution of the previous Council .
The Councilors can be elected on two equal constituencies .
Half are elected in equal number from each of the seven administrative parishes and the other half of the Councilors are elected from a single national constituency .
Fifteen days following the election , the Councilors convene in their inaugural session .
During this session , the Syndic General , who is the head of the General Council , and the Subsyndic General , his assistant , are elected .
Eight days later , the Council convenes once more .
During this session the Head of Government , the Prime Minister of Andorra , is chosen from among the Councilors .
Candidates for nomination can be proposed by a minimum of one-fifth of the Councilors .
The Council then elects the candidate with the absolute majority of votes to be Head of Government .
The Syndic General then notifies the Coprinces who in turn appoint the elected candidate as the Prime Minister of Andorra .
The General Council also is responsible for proposing and passing laws .
Bills may be presented to the Council as Private Members ' Bills by three of the Local Parish Councils jointly or one tenth of the citizens of Andorra .
The Council also approves the annual budget of the principality .
The government must submit the proposed budget for parliamentary approval at least two months before the current budget expires .
If the budget is not approved by the first day of the next year , the previous budget is extended until a new one is approved .
Once any bill is approved , the Syndic General is responsible for presenting it to the Coprinces so that they may sign and enact it .
If the Head of Government is not satisfied with the Council , he may request that the Coprinces dissolve the Council and order new elections .
In turn , the Councilors have the power to remove the Head of Government from office .
After a motion of censure is approved by at least one-fifth of the Councilors , the Council will vote and if it receives the absolute majority of votes , the Prime Minister is removed .
The Judiciary is composed of the Magistrates Court , the Criminal Law Court , the High Court of Andorra , and the Constitutional Court .
The High Court of Justice is composed of five judges : one appointed by the Head of Government , one each by the Coprinces , one by the Syndic General , and one by the Judges and Magistrates .
It is presided over by the member appointed by the Syndic General and the judges hold office for six-year terms .
The Magistrates and Judges are appointed by the High Court and so is the President of the Criminal Law Court .
The High Court also appoints members of the Office of the Attorney General .
The Constitutional Court is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and reviewing all appeals of unconstitutionality against laws and treaties .
The Court is composed of four judges , one appointed by each of the Coprinces and two by the General Council .
They serve eight-year terms .
The Court is presided over by one of the Judges on a two year rotation so that each judge at one point will be the leader of the Court .
Responsibility for defending Andorra rests with Spain and France .
Andorra currently has very limited nominal military force , used for ceremonial purposes only .

Tourism , the mainstay of Andorra 's tiny , well-to-do economy , accounts for roughly 80 % of GDP .
An estimated 9 million tourists visit annually , attracted by Andorra 's duty-free status and by its summer and winter resorts .
Andorra 's comparative advantage has recently eroded as the economies of adjoining France and Spain have been opened up , providing broader availability of goods and lower tariffs .
The banking sector , with its tax haven status , also contributes substantially to the economy .
Agricultural production is limited—only 2 % of the land is arable—and most food has to be imported .
Some tobacco is grown locally .
The principal livestock activity is domestic sheep raising .
Manufacturing output consists mainly of cigarettes , cigars , and furniture .
Andorra 's natural resources include hydroelectric power , mineral water , timber , iron ore , and lead .

Andorra lacks a currency of its own and uses that of its two surrounding nations .
Prior to 2002 these were the French franc and the Spanish peseta , which have since been both replaced by the EU 's single currency , the euro .
Andorra is negotiating to issue its own euro coins .
