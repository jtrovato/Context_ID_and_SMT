'''''Mrs Dalloway''''' (published on 14 May 1925<ref name="Whitworth2005">{{cite book|last=Whitworth|first=Michael H.|title=Virginia Woolf (Authors in Context)|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cvt4srFQ5V4C&pg=PR15|accessdate=14 May 2013|date=13 January 2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780191516566|page=15}}</ref>) is a novel by [[Virginia Woolf]] that details a day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway, a fictional [[High society (group)|high-society]] woman in post-[[First World War]] England. It is one of Woolf's best-known novels.

Created from two short stories, "Mrs Dalloway in Bond Street" and the unfinished "The Prime Minister," the novel addresses Clarissa's preparations for a party she will host that evening. With an interior perspective, the story travels forwards and back in time and in and out of the characters' minds to construct an image of Clarissa's life and of the inter-war social structure. In October 2005, ''Mrs Dalloway'' was included on ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine's list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923.<ref>{{cite web | date= 8 January 2010

==Plot summary==
Clarissa Dalloway goes around London in the morning, getting ready to host a party that evening. The nice day reminds her of her youth spent in the countryside in Bourton and makes her wonder about her choice of husband; she married the reliable Richard Dalloway instead of the enigmatic and demanding Peter Walsh, and she "had not the option" to be with Sally Seton. Peter reintroduces these conflicts by paying a visit that morning.

Septimus Warren Smith, a [[First World War]] veteran suffering from [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|deferred traumatic stress]], spends his day in the park with his Italian-born wife Lucrezia, where Peter Walsh observes them. Septimus is visited by frequent and indecipherable [[hallucinations]], mostly concerning his dear friend Evans who died in the war. Later that day, after he is prescribed [[involuntary commitment]] to a psychiatric hospital, he commits suicide by jumping out of a window.

Clarissa's party in the evening is a slow success. It is attended by most of the characters she has met in the book, including people from her past. She hears about Septimus' suicide at the party and gradually comes to admire this stranger's act, which she considers an effort to preserve the purity of his happiness.

==Characters==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2014}}
{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}
;Sir William Bradshaw
Sir William Bradshaw is a famous psychiatrist to whom Septimus' physician, Dr. Holmes, refers Septimus. Bradshaw notes that Septimus has had a complete nervous breakdown and suggests spending time in the country as a cure.

;Clarissa Dalloway
Clarissa Dalloway is the 52-year-old<ref>{{Citation | quote = She had just broken into her fifty-second year | last = Woolf | first = Virginia | title = Mrs Dalloway | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2009 | format = print | page = 31}}.</ref> protagonist of the novel. She is Richard's wife and Elizabeth's mother, and, while reminiscing about her past, spends the day organising a party that will be held that night. She is self-conscious about her role in London high society.

;Elizabeth Dalloway
Elizabeth Dalloway is Clarissa and Richard's 17-year-old daughter. She is said to look "oriental" and has great composure. Compared to her mother, she takes great pleasure in politics and modern history, hoping to be either a doctor or farmer in the future. She would rather spend time in the country with her father than at her mother's party.

;Richard Dalloway
Richard Dalloway is Clarissa's disconnected and haughty husband. He is immersed in his work in government.

;Miss Kilman
Miss Doris Kilman, originally "Kiehlman", is Elizabeth's schoolmistress for history and is a born-again Christian. She has a degree in history and during the Great War was dismissed from her teaching job because "Miss Dolby thought she would be happier with people who shared her views about the Germans".<ref>''Mrs Dalloway'' 1976, p. 110; the name "Miss Dolby" may refer to the headmistress of [[Bedford Girls' Modern School]] at the time.</ref> She has a German ancestry and wears an unattractive mackintosh coat because she is uninterested in dressing to please others. She dislikes Clarissa intensely but loves to spend time with Elizabeth.
{{col-2}}
;Sally Seton
Sally Seton is a love interest of Clarissa's, with whom she shared a kiss, who is married to Lord Rosseter and has five boys. Sally had a strained relationship with her family and spent substantial time with Clarissa's family in her youth. She can be described as feisty as well as a youthful ragamuffin.

;Lucrezia "Rezia" Smith
Lucrezia "Rezia" Smith is Septimus' Italian wife. She is burdened by his mental illness and believes she is judged because of it. During most of the novel she is homesick for her family and country, which she left to marry Septimus after the Armistice.

;Septimus Warren Smith
Septimus Warren Smith is a World War I veteran who suffers from "[[shell shock]]" and hallucinations of his deceased friend, Evans. Educated and decorated in the war, he is detached from society. He is married to Lucrezia, from whom he has grown distant.

;Peter Walsh
Peter Walsh is an old friend of Clarissa's. In the past, she rejected his marriage proposal. Now he has returned to England from India and is one of Clarissa's party guests. He plans to marry Daisy, a married woman in India, and has returned to try to arrange a divorce for his current wife.

;Hugh Whitbread
Hugh Whitbread is a pompous friend of Clarissa's, who holds an unspecified position in the British Royal household. Like Clarissa, he places great importance on his place in society. Although he believes he is an essential member of the British aristocracy, Lady Bruton, Clarissa, Richard, and Peter find him obnoxious.

==Style==
In ''Mrs Dalloway'', all of the action, aside from the [[flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], takes place on a day in June. It is an example of [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream of consciousness]] storytelling: every scene closely tracks the momentary thoughts of a particular character. Woolf blurs the distinction between [[Direct speech|direct]] and [[indirect speech]] throughout the novel, freely alternating her [[Narrative mode|mode of narration]] between [[Third-person omniscient|omniscient description]], [[free indirect discourse|indirect]] [[interior monologue]], and [[soliloquy]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Dowling |first=David |title=Mrs Dalloway: Mapping Streams of Consciousness |page=46 |year=1991 |publisher=Twayne Publishers |isbn=978-0-8057-9414-4}}</ref> The narration follows at least twenty characters in this way, but the bulk of the novel is spent with Clarissa Dalloway and Septimus Smith.

Because of structural and stylistic similarities, ''Mrs Dalloway'' is commonly thought to be a response to [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', a text that is often considered one of the greatest novels of the twentieth century (though Woolf herself, writing in 1928, apparently denied this<ref name="1928 essay by Woolf"/>).
In her essay "Modern Fiction," Woolf praised ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', saying of the scene in the cemetery, "on a first reading at any rate, it is difficult not to acclaim a masterpiece."<ref>[http://books.google.es/books?id=p1qso99TB6IC&pg=PA899&lpg=PA899&dq=%22%22on+a+first+reading+at+any+rate,+it+is+difficult+not+to+acclaim+a+masterpiece%22%22&source=bl&ots=CZMtHu0gv1&sig=CZpMaKBhE3Uttiw5xnLul-E1mj4&hl=en&ei=8kNZTIecI4aI4gbA16irCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22%22on%20a%20first%20reading%20at%20any%20rate%2C%20it%20is%20difficult%20not%20to%20acclaim%20a%20masterpiece%22%22&f=false Rainey, Lawrence S. ''Modernism: an anthology'' Wiley-Blackwell, 2005] at [[Google Books]]. Retrieved 4 August 2010</ref> The [[Hogarth Press]], run by her and her husband [[Leonard Woolf|Leonard]], had to turn down the chance to publish the novel in 1919, because of the obscenity law in England, as well as the practical issues regarding publishing such a substantial text.

Woolf laid out some of her literary goals with the characters of ''Mrs Dalloway'' while still working on the novel. A year before its publication, she gave a talk at Cambridge University called "[http://www.ibiblio.org/sally/woolf.html Character in Fiction]," revised and retitled later that year as "Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://modernism.research.yale.edu/wiki/index.php/%22Mr._Bennett_and_Mrs._Brown%22 |title="Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown" – Modernism Lab Essays |publisher=Modernism.research.yale.edu |date=6 April 2009 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref>

==Themes==
The novel has two main narrative lines involving two separate characters (Clarissa Dalloway and Septimus Smith); within each narrative there is a particular time and place in the past that the main characters keep returning to in their minds. For Clarissa, the "continuous present" ([[Gertrude Stein]]'s phrase) of her charmed youth at Bourton keeps intruding into her thoughts on this day in London. For Septimus, the "continuous present" of his time as a soldier during the "Great War" keeps intruding, especially in the form of Evans, his fallen comrade.

===Mental illness===
Septimus, as the [[Post-traumatic stress disorder|shell-shocked]] war hero, operates as a pointed criticism of the treatment of [[mental illness]] and depression.<ref name="Childs" /> Woolf criticises medical discourse through Septimus' decline and suicide; his doctors make snap judgments about his condition, talk to him mainly through his wife, and dismiss his urgent confessions before he can make them. Rezia remarks that Septimus "was not ill. Dr Holmes said there was nothing the matter with him."<ref name="autogenerated1">Woolf, Virginia. “Mrs Dalloway.” Oxford University Press. 2009. Print.</ref>

Woolf goes beyond commenting on the treatment of [[mental illness]]. Using the characters of Clarissa and Rezia, she makes the argument that people can only interpret Septimus' shell shock according to their cultural norms.<ref name="Joyes, Kaley 2008 pp. 69-87">Joyes, Kaley. "Failed Witnessing in Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway." ''Woolf Studies Annual'' vol 14 (2008) pp. 69–87</ref> Throughout the course of the novel Clarissa does not meet Septimus. Clarissa's reality is vastly different from that of Septimus; his presence in London is unknown to Clarissa until his death becomes the subject of idle chatter at her party. By never having these characters meet, Woolf is suggesting that mental illness can be contained to the individuals who suffer from it without others, who remain unaffected, ever having to witness it.<ref>Guth, Deborah. "What A Lark! What a Plunge! Fiction as Self-Evasion in Mrs Dalloway." University of Tel Aviv 19–25.</ref> This allows Woolf to weave her criticism of the treatment of the [[mentally ill]] with her larger argument, which is the criticism of society's class structure. Her use of Septimus as the stereotypically traumatised veteran is her way of showing that there were still reminders of the [[First World War]] in London in 1923.<ref name="Joyes, Kaley 2008 pp. 69-87"/> These ripples affect Mrs. Dalloway and readers spanning generations. Shell shock, or [[post traumatic stress disorder]], is an important addition to the early 20th century canon of post-war British literature.<ref>Lord, Catherine M. "The Frames of Septimus Smith: Through Twenty Four Hours in the 
City of Mrs. Dalloway, 1923, and of Millennial London: Art is a Shocking Experience." parallax 5.3 (1999): 36–46.

There are similarities in Septimus' condition to Woolf's struggles with [[bipolar disorder]]. Both [[hallucination|hallucinate]] that birds sing in [[Greek language|Greek]], and Woolf once attempted to throw herself out of a window as Septimus does.<ref name="Childs" /> Woolf had also been treated for her condition at various asylums, from which her antipathy towards doctors developed. Woolf committed suicide by drowning, sixteen years after the publication of ''Mrs Dalloway''.<ref name="Virginia Woolf">{{cite web|url=http://modernism.research.yale.edu/wiki/index.php/Virginia_Woolf |title=Virginia Woolf – Modernism Lab Essays |publisher=Modernism.research.yale.edu |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref>

Woolf's original plan for her novel called for Clarissa to kill herself during her party. In this original version, Septimus (whom Woolf called Mrs. Dalloway's "double") did not appear at all.<ref name="1928 essay by Woolf">[http://books.google.com/books?id=NBvFfI7g5y8C&pg=PA10#v=onepage&q&f=false 1928 essay by Woolf]</ref>

===Existential issues===
When Peter Walsh sees a girl in the street and [[stalking|stalks]] her for half an hour, he notes that his relationship to the girl was "made up, as one makes up the better part of life."  By focusing on characters' thoughts and perceptions, Woolf emphasises the significance of private thoughts rather than concrete events in a person's life. Most of the plot in ''Mrs Dalloway'' consists of realisations that the characters subjectively make.<ref name="Childs" />

Fueled by her bout of ill health, Clarissa Dalloway is emphasised as a woman who appreciates life. Her love of party-throwing comes from a desire to bring people together and create happy moments. Her charm, according to Peter Walsh who loves her, is a sense of ''joie de vivre'', always summarised by the sentence: "There she was."  She interprets Septimus Smith's death as an act of embracing life and her mood remains light, even though she hears about it in the midst of the party.

===Feminism===
As a commentary on inter-war society, Clarissa's character highlights the role of women as the proverbial "[[Angel in the House]]" and embodies sexual and economic repression and the [[narcissism]] of bourgeois women who have never known the hunger and insecurity of working women. She keeps up with and even embraces the social expectations of the wife of a patrician politician, but she is still able to express herself and find distinction in the parties she throws.<ref name="Childs" />

Her old friend Sally Seton, whom Clarissa admires dearly, is remembered as a great independent woman:<ref name="Childs" /> She smoked cigars, once ran down a corridor naked to fetch her sponge-bag, and made bold, unladylike statements to get a reaction from people. When Clarissa meets her in the present day, Sally turns out to be a perfect housewife, having married a self-made rich man and given birth to five sons.

===Homosexuality===
Clarissa Dalloway is strongly attracted to Sally Seton at Bourton. Thirty four years later, Clarissa still considers the kiss they shared to be the happiest moment of her life.  She feels about Sally "as men feel,"<ref>from ''Mrs Dalloway'', Penguin Popular Classics 1996, page 36 OR Harcourt, Inc. (2005), Page 35</ref> but she does not recognise these feelings as signs of homosexuality.

Similarly, Septimus is haunted by the image of his dear friend Evans. Evans, his commanding officer, is described as being "undemonstrative in the company of women." The narrator describes Septimus and Evans behaving together like "two dogs playing on a hearth-rug" who, inseparable, "had to be together, share with each other, fight with each other, quarrel with each other...." Jean E. Kennard notes that the word "share" could easily be read in a [[E.M. Forster|Forsteran]] manner, perhaps as in Forster's ''[[Maurice (novel)|Maurice]]'', which shows the word's use in this period to describe homosexual relations. Kennard is one to note Septimus' "increasing revulsion at the idea of heterosexual sex," abstaining from sex with Rezia and feeling that "the business of copulation was filth to him before the end."<ref>Kennard, Jean E. "Power and Sexual Ambiguity: The ''Dreadnought'' Hoax, ''The Voyage Out'', ''Mrs Dalloway'' and ''Orlando''" ''Journal of Modern Literature'', Vol. 20, No. 2 (Winter, 1996), pp. 149–164.</ref>

==Film adaptation==
{{Main|Mrs Dalloway (film)}}
Dutch film director [[Marleen Gorris]] made a film version of ''Mrs Dalloway'' in 1997.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b7f863eca| title= Mrs Dalloway (1997)| publisher= British Film Institute| accessdate= 5 July 2014}}</ref> It was adapted from Woolf's novel by British actress [[Eileen Atkins]] and starred [[Vanessa Redgrave]] in the title role. The cast included [[Natascha McElhone]], [[Lena Headey]], [[Rupert Graves]], [[Michael Kitchen]], [[Alan Cox (actor)|Alan Cox]], [[Sarah Badel]], and [[Katie Carr]].

{{Main|The Hours (film)}}
A related 2002 film, based on Michael Cunningham's [[The Hours (novel)|novel of the same name]], is ''[[The Hours (film)|The Hours]]'', starring [[Meryl Streep]] as New York editor Clarissa, [[Julianne Moore]] as Los Angeles housewife Laura, and [[Nicole Kidman]] as [[Virginia Woolf]]. ''The Hours'' is about a single day in the lives of three women of different generations who are affected by ''Mrs Dalloway'': Woolf is writing it, Laura is reading it, and Clarissa is living it out.

==Other appearances==
Mrs Dalloway also appears in Virginia Woolf's first novel, ''[[The Voyage Out]]'', as well as five of her short stories, in which she hosts dinner parties to which the main subject of the narrative is invited:{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}
*"[[The New Dress (short story)|The New Dress]]" –  a self-conscious guest has a new dress made for the event
* "The Introduction" – whose main character is Lily Everit
*"Together and Apart" – Mrs Dalloway introduces the main protagonists
*"The Man Who Loved His Kind" – Mrs Dalloway's husband Richard invites a school friend, who finds the evening uncomfortable in the extreme
*"A Summing Up" – a couple meet in her garden
