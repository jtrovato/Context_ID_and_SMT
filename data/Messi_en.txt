[[File:Lionel Messi (2009).jpg|thumb|Messi during a Barcelona training session at the [[Camp Nou]] on 21 May 2009]]
Messi was at one stage romantically linked to Macarena Lemos, also from his hometown of Rosario. He is said to have been introduced to her by the girl's father when he returned to Rosario to recover from his injury a few days before the start of the 2006 World Cup.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gente.com.ar/nota.php?ID=11359|title=Lionel me prometió venir a mi cumple de quince después del Mundial|publisher=Gente Online|accessdate=18 June 2009 |language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.vefutbol.com.mx/notas/16849.html |title=Aún le mueve el tapete a Messi |publisher=El Universal |date=19 June 2008 |accessdate=18 June 2009 |language=Spanish |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090531053417/http://www.vefutbol.com.mx/notas/16849.html |archivedate=31 May 2009 }}</ref> He has in the past also been linked to the Argentine [[glamour model]] [[Luciana Salazar]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://elcomercio.pe/ediciononline/html/2008-06-20/luciana-salazar-la-nueva-novia-messi.html|title=Luciana Salazar, ¿la nueva novia de Messi?|publisher=El Comercio|date=20 June 2008 |accessdate=18 June 2009 |language=Spanish}}</ref><ref name="Messi y Antonella pasean"/>

However, the birth came later than expected. On 2 November 2012, Messi became a father for the first time following the birth of his son Thiago. FC Barcelona's official website briefly stated "Leo Messi is a father".

Messi has two cousins also involved in football: [[Maxi Biancucchi|Maxi]], a winger for [[Club Olimpia]] of Paraguay, and [[Emanuel Biancucchi]], who plays as a midfielder for Paraguay's [[Independiente F.B.C.]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/esportes/seu_time/flamengo/2007/08/20/maxi_afirma_que_messi_deve_vir_ao_brasil_para_ve_lo_jogar_972383.html|title=Maxi afirma que Messi deve vir ao Brasil para vê-lo jogar|publisher=Último Segundo|date=20 August 2007 |accessdate=3 November 2009 |language=Portuguese}}{{dead link|date=July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tz-online.de/sport/fussball/tsv-1860/biancucchi-hoert-mir-mit-messi-auf-498339.html|title=Hört mir auf mit Messi!|publisher=TZ Online|date=20 October 2009 |accessdate=3 November 2009 |language=German|first=Claudius |last=Mayer}}</ref>

In 2013, Messi, a devout Roman Catholic, met [[Pope Francis]], himself a fan of Argentine club [[San Lorenzo de Almagro|San Lorenzo]], at the Vatican, with Messi stating; “Without a doubt, today was one of the most special days of my life. We have to excel on and off the field.”<ref>[http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2013/08/13/pope-francis-meets-argentine-and-italian-football-stars-in-rome/ "Pope Francis welcomes Argentine and Italian football stars to the Vatican"].

Messi has maintained close ties to Rosario and his family since leaving for Spain, and has gone to great lengths to maintain them. He keeps in daily contact via phone and text with a small group of confidants from Rosario, most of them fellow members of "The Machine of '87". One time when he was in training with the Argentina national team in Buenos Aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and then returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice. Messi has also kept ownership of his old house in Rosario, although his family no longer lives in it; he maintains a penthouse apartment in an exclusive residential building in which his mother lives (Messi's father spends most of his time in Spain with him), as well as a family compound just outside the city.<ref name=Thompson/>

===Charity===
In 2007, Messi established the Leo Messi Foundation, a charity supporting access to education and health care for vulnerable children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundacionleomessi.org/nuestra-fundacion.php |title=Fundación Leo Messi – Nuestra Fundación |publisher=Fundacíon Leo Messi |accessdate=7 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundacionleomessi.org/index.php |title=Fundación Leo Messi – Home |publisher=Fundacíon Leo Messi |accessdate=7 June 2010}}</ref> In response to Messi's own childhood medical difficulties, the Leo Messi Foundation has offered Argentine children diagnosed with illnesses treatment in Spain and funds covering the transport, hospital and recuperation costs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.leo-messi.net/new-foundation-lionel-messi__921.aspx/ |title=Foundation Lionel Messi |publisher=En.leo-messi.net |accessdate=7 June 2010}}{{dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref> Messi's foundation is supported by his own fundraising activity with additional assistance from [[Herbalife]].

He and Newell's have also ended a long public feud. Messi funded the construction of a dormitory inside [[Estadio Marcelo Bielsa|Newell's stadium]] for the club's youth academy, as well as a new gymnasium for the club. For their part, Newell's has begun to embrace their ties with Messi, and plans to issue a special club membership card to Messi's son.<ref name=Thompson/>

In March 2013, Lionel Messi donated €600,000 towards the refurbishment of a children's hospital in his hometown of Rosario, Argentina. The money was used to renovate the oncology unit at the Victor J Vilela Children's Hospital, as well as paying for doctors to travel to Barcelona for training.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marca.com/2013/03/09/en/football/barcelona/1362859034.html |title=Messi helps mission against child cancer |publisher=Marca.com |date=9 March 2013 |accessdate=12 March 2013 }}</ref>

In January 2015, Messi teamed up with tennis star [[Serena Williams]] as ambassadors in a new campaign, called '''1 in 11''' (represents the number of children worldwide who are unable to attend school), the result of a collaboration between [[UNICEF]], the [[F.C. Barcelona|F.C. Barcelona Foundation]], and [[Reach Out To Asia]] (ROTA).

In March 2010, ''[[France Football]]'' ranked Messi at the top of its list of the world's richest footballers, ahead of [[David Beckham]] and [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], with €33&nbsp;million ($45&nbsp;million) in combined income from salaries, bonuses and off-field earnings for the previous 12 months.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/soccer/blog/dirty-tackle/post/Davey-Becks-no-longer-the-world-s-best-paid-foot?urn=sow-229808 |title=Davey Becks no longer the world's best paid footballer |date=23 March 2010 |first=Brooks |last=Peck |accessdate=9 January 2012 |publisher=Yahoo!}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/messi-tops-rich-list-ahead-of-beckham/242045-5-21.html |title=Messi tops rich list ahead of Beckham – Sports – Football – ibnlive |publisher=Ibnlive.in.com |date=23 March 2012 |accessdate=28 July 2012}}</ref> In May 2014, ''[[Forbes]]'' ranked Messi second behind Cristiano Ronaldo in their list of the world's highest paid players with earnings of $65&nbsp;million in the previous 12 months.<ref>{{cite web |title=The world's highest paid football players |url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/christinasettimi/2014/05/07/the-worlds-highest-paid-soccer-players-3/ |publisher=Forbes.com |date=7 May 2014 |accessdate=8 May 2014 }}</ref>

====Salary====
In December 2012, Barcelona announced that Messi would sign a five-year contract extension which will keep him at the club until 2018 and raising his base salary to €16&nbsp;million ($21.2&nbsp;million) net, which will make him the highest on-field earner in football. As the tax bracket for this level of income in Spain is 56%, it means that Barcelona will have to pay Messi's income tax of a little over €20&nbsp;million ($26.5&nbsp;million).<ref>{{cite news |first=Agustino |last=Fontevecchia |title=FC Barcelona Giving Lionel Messi A Raise After A Record 2012 |url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/afontevecchia/2012/12/19/fc-barcelona-giving-lionel-messi-a-raise-after-his-record-year/ |publisher=Forbes.com |date=19 December 2012 |accessdate=8 May 2014 }}</ref> His formal buy-out clause remains at €250&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news |first=Sid |last=Lowe |title=Lionel Messi agrees new contract to stay at Barcelona until 2018 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/dec/18/lionel-messi-new-contract-barcelona-2018 |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media |location=London |date=18 December 2012 |accessdate=8 May 2014 }}</ref>

====Tax evasion====
Messi's father, Jorge Horacio Messi, was under investigation for an alleged €4&nbsp;million in unpaid taxes from 2007 to 2009. Messi and his father were accused of channelling funds through the United Kingdom and Switzerland, to a number of shell companies set up in tax havens of Belize and Uruguary, in order to shield royalties and other licensing income from Spanish income tax which allowed them to avoid paying around €4.165&nbsp;million.<ref>[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-22877408]</ref><ref>[http://www.theweek.co.uk/football/53569/lionel-messi-could-face-six-years-jail-if-tax-fraud-proved]</ref>

The elder Messi made a payment of over €5&nbsp;million in August 2013 to cover the unpaid taxes, plus interest. The prosecutor originally agreed that Jorge was responsible for the tax schemes and recommended that the charges be dismissed. However, a Barcelona court stated that there was sufficient evidence proving that the younger Messi should have known about and consented to the tax scheme and ordered them both to stand trial on tax evasion charges in autumn 2014.<ref>[http://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2014/07/28/spanish-court-moving-forward-with-messi-tax-evasion-case/]</ref><ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/lionel-messi-fails-to-get-tax-fraud-charges-dropped-1.2720171]</ref><ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/tax-fraud-case-against-lionel-messi-goes-ahead-141828006.html]</ref>
