==History==

===Predecessor companies===
In 1925, Fred C. Koch joined [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] classmate Lewis E. Winkler at an engineering firm in Wichita, Kansas, which was renamed the Winkler-Koch Engineering Company. In 1927 they developed a more efficient thermal cracking process for turning crude oil into gasoline. This process threatened the competitive advantage of established oil companies, which sued for patent infringement. Temporarily forced out of business in the United States, they turned to other markets, including the [[Soviet Union]], where Winkler-Koch built 15 cracking units between 1929 and 1932. During this time, Koch came to despise communism and [[Joseph Stalin]]'s regime.<ref name=TSOS_Koch>{{cite book |title=[[The Science of Success]]: How Market-Based Management Built the World's Largest Private Company |last=Koch |first=Charles C. |authorlink=Charles G.

Koch, "Virtually every engineer he worked with [there] was purged."<ref name=Fisher_Forbes/>

In 1940, Koch joined new partners to create a new firm, the Wood River Oil and Refining Company, which is today known as Koch Industries. In 1946 the firm acquired the Rock Island refinery and crude oil gathering system near [[Duncan, Oklahoma]]. Wood River was later renamed the Rock Island Oil & Refining Company.<ref name=Marshall/> Charles G. Koch joined Rock Island in 1961, having started his career at the management consulting firm [[Arthur D. Little]]. He became president in 1966 and chairman at age 32, upon his father's death the following year.<ref name=SEC_2005>{{cite web |url= http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/41077/000119312505225697/dex993.htm |title=Summary of Koch Industries History |author= |date=14 November 2005 |work=sec.gov |publisher=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission |accessdate=18 February 2010}}</ref><ref name=101_Forbes>{{cite news |title=Creative destruction 101 |author=Bruce Upbin |author2=Brandon Copple |magazine=Forbes |date=14 December 1998 |url= }}</ref>

===Koch Industries===
The company was renamed Koch Industries in 1968 in honor of Fred Koch, the year after his death. At that time, it was primarily an engineering firm with part interest in the [[Pine Bend Refinery]] in Minnesota, a crude oil-gathering system in Oklahoma,<ref name=Fisher_Forbes/> and some cattle ranches.<ref>{{cite book |title=Rich Grass and Sweet Water |last=John |first=Lincoln |year=1989 |publisher=Texas A&M University Press |location=College Station |isbn=0-89096-387-8 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> In 1968, Charles approached Union Oil of California about buying their interest in Great Northern Oil Company and its Pine Bend Refinery but the discussions quickly stalled after Union asked for a large premium.<ref name=TSOS_Koch/> In 1969, Union Oil began trying to market their interest in Great Northern by telling potential buyers that Koch's controlling interest could be thwarted by currying favor with another owner, [[J. Howard Marshall|J. Howard Marshall II]]. When Marshall discovered this he threw his lot in with Koch, they together acquired a majority interest in the company and ultimately bought Union's interest.<ref name=Marshall>{{cite book |title=Done in Oil: An Autobiography |last=J.

These were followed by global commodity trading, gas liquids processing, real estate, pulp and paper, risk management and finance.<ref name=TSOS_Koch/>

In 1970, Charles was joined at the family firm by his brother [[David H. Koch]]. Having started as a technical services manager, David became president of Koch Engineering in 1979.

Koch Industries is responsible for 25% of [[Athabasca oil sands|Canadian oil sands]] imports to the United States.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fraser Institute co-founder confirms 'years and years' of U.S. oil billionaires' funding |first=David P. |last=Ball |date=April 27, 2012 |newspaper=[[Vancouver Observer]] |accessdate=March 18, 2015 |url=http://www.vancouverobserver.com/politics/2012/04/26/fraser-institute-co-founder-confirms-years-and-years-us-oil-billionaires-funding}}</ref>

The Matador Land and Cattle Company was founded in 1882 by Scottish investors, whose acquisition included 2.5 million acres in four Texas counties. In 1951, the company was sold to [[Lazard|Lazard Frères & Co.]], which in turn sold some of the Texas land to Fred C. Koch. In 1952 Koch formed Matador Cattle Company, and later one of his companies purchased part of Matador Ranch, which was brought together with other Koch ranches in Montana and Kansas. Today, according to the ranch's website, it “is owned and operated by Matador Cattle Company, a division of Koch Agriculture Company, which is an indirect, {{sic|hide=y|wholly|-}}owned subsidiary of Koch Industries.”<ref>{{cite web|title=The History of Matador Ranch|url=http://www.matadorranch.com/matadorranchhistory.php|publisher=Matador Ranch|accessdate=12 April 2012}}</ref>

In 1996, an 8-inch-diameter steel [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] pipeline operated by Koch Pipeline Company ruptured near Lively, Texas and began leaking [[butane]] gas.  The vapor cloud ignited when two residents drove their pickup truck through the flammable vapors to get to a neighbor's house to call [[9-1-1]] to report the leak.  The two were killed in the explosion, and approximately 25 families were later evacuated from the neighborhood without injury.  An investigation conducted by the [[NTSB]] found that the pipe section which failed had not been shown to have excessive corrosion in a 1995 inspection.  Regulations at the time did not provide criteria for "adequate cathodic protection."<ref>[http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/1998/PAR9802.pdf NTSB report] PIPELINE ACCIDENT SUMMARY REPORT,  PIPELINE RUPTURE, LIQUID BUTANE RELEASE, AND FIRE.LIVELY, TEXAS

==Legal issues==
In 2008, Koch Industries discovered that the French affiliate Koch-Glitsch had violated bribery laws allegedly securing contracts in [[Algeria]], [[Egypt]], [[India]], [[Morocco]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] after an investigation by Ethics Compliance officer, Egorova-Farines.<ref name="flout"/>  After Koch Industries' investigative team looked into her findings, the four employees involved were terminated.  A [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] article states that Egorova-Farines reported her findings immediately, and even after Koch’s investigators substantiated the findings, her “superiors removed her from the inquiry in August 2008 and fired her in June 2009, calling her incompetent.”<ref name="flout"/>  Koch Industries’ general counsel, Mark Holden, gave a different account of the events to Jennifer Rubin of the Washington Post.<ref name=Rubin>{{cite news |last=Rubin|first=Jennifer |title=Koch responds to Bloomberg |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/koch-responds-to-bloomberg/2011/03/29/gIQA3KzNIL_blog.html |work= The Washington Post |accessdate=5 October 2011 |date=3 October 2011}}</ref>  Holden stated that Egorova-Farines failed to promptly share the findings, choosing instead to give the information to a manager at Koch-Glitsch who was later fired for bribery.  Rubin writes that, according to Holden, “Egorova-Farines was not fired but instead ran into performance problems, left the company to go on leave and never returned.”  Egorova-Farines sued Koch-Glitsch for wrongful termination in [[France]].  Rubin writes that she lost and “was ordered to pay costs for bringing a frivolous case.”<ref name=Rubin/>
