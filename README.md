Introduction
============

Description of Objective function:
----------------------------------
The underlying task of alignment must be graded with respect to hand aligned data. Because we require the true "labels" we must split the data into testing a training set. This ensures that results are not being evaluated on the data used to train the algorithms. This separation is standard in machine learning applications. With a sufficient test set,
